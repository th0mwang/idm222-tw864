<p>One of the most important experiences of my life was my time in Boy Scouts.  Before I joined,
     I wasn't exactly the best person I could've been.  I knew I wanted to do art as a career, but I didn't have that much drive or any idea on what to do to acheive that.
       When I joined, I didn't immediately change into a better person, it was definitely a slow burn to becoming a better person.
